description: Review a completed Codex turn for durable skill improvements, using the chatgpt-codex-self-improving-skills plugin's skill-manager tools or scripts. Use after user corrections, repeated workflow friction, non-trivial debugging techniques, or when the Stop hook requests a self-improvement pass.

# Codex Self-Improvement Review

Use this skill to decide whether a recent interaction should update Codex's reusable skills. Treat skills as procedural memory: they record how to do a class of task, not one-off facts.

## Review Policy

Inspect the current thread evidence before writing anything. Then walk this
ladder and act on the EARLIEST rung that applies (Hermes review-priority
order):

1. **Patch a skill that was in play this session.** If a skill was loaded or
   invoked (`$skill-name`) during this thread and it turned out wrong, stale,
   or incomplete — that is the skill to fix first. It routed the work, so its
   gaps are exactly what future sessions will hit.
2. **Extend an existing relevant skill.** Prefer adding the gotcha, corrected
   step, or example to a skill that already governs this class of task over
   creating a new narrow sibling.
3. **Embed the corrected preference in the governing skill.** User corrections
   about workflow, tone, formatting, or verification belong in the body of the
   skill that governs that class of task — so the next session starts already
   corrected.
4. **Create a new skill — last resort.** Only when the learning is class-level
   and likely to recur, and no existing skill covers it.

Additional rules:

- **Name anti-patterns** (a bad name means the knowledge is not class-level —
  fall back up the ladder or capture nothing): a PR number, an error string, a
  session label like `fix-X` / `debug-Y`, a bare library name with no
  technique, anything tied to one instance.
- **Duplicates: report, don't merge.** If you notice two skills covering the
  same ground, note it in your output — consolidation is the
  `$codex-skill-curator` pass's job, not the review's.
- Do not encode transient errors that resolved within the session (if a retry
  worked, the lesson — if any — is the retry pattern, not the failure), missing
  binaries, one-off paths, temporary outages, or negative claims like "tool X
  does not work". Setup failures are capturable only as the FIX (install
  command, config, env var).
- Never edit bundled/system/admin skills. Work in user or repo skill roots only.
- Keep changes small, make a backup first, and report the diff summary.

## Authoring Standards

- `description` is ONE short sentence stating the capability. After writing
  it, count the length yourself and trim BEFORE saving — long descriptions
  bloat skill discovery and degrade routing (the store warns above
  ~200 chars and hard-rejects above 1024).
- Record only commands, flags, and paths you actually ran or observed in this
  thread — never invent plausible-looking ones.
- Never write environment-derived identity (OS username, email, git config)
  into frontmatter fields such as `author` — skills get shared, and that is a
  privacy leak the user never opted into.

## Tooling

Prefer the plugin MCP tools when available:

- `codex_skill_list`
- `codex_skill_view` — also unlocks patch/write for the viewed file
  (read-before-write guard: editing an existing file you never viewed in this
  session is rejected; view first, then edit using the returned content)
- `codex_skill_create` — pass `reason` to record why the skill exists
- `codex_skill_patch`
- `codex_skill_write_file`
- `codex_skill_archive`
- `codex_skill_curate`
- `codex_skill_backups` / `codex_skill_rollback` — list backups and restore
  one by exact backup_id (the rollback itself is undoable)
- `codex_skill_scan` — advisory secrets/injection scan of one skill
- `codex_self_improvement_status`

If the MCP server is not active, run the local helper script from this plugin:

```bash
python3 ../../scripts/skill_manager_cli.py status
python3 ../../scripts/skill_manager_cli.py list
python3 ../../scripts/skill_manager_cli.py curate --dry-run
```

Resolve script paths relative to this `SKILL.md` location.

## Output

If no durable improvement exists, say so briefly. If you changed a skill, report:

- skill name
- action taken
- backup id
- short reason
